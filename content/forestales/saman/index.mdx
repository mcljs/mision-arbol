In “Addiction to Design,” Natasha Shull explores fundamental questions about the interface between human beings and machines. In studying the industry of machine gambling and the individuals who find themselves hopelessly trapped in addictions to these gaming devices, she finds a new intensity of engaged experience facilitated by the nature of the technology which the players themselves refer to as ‘the zone.’

A form of embodied reality where “time, space, and social identity are suspended in the mechanical rhythm of a repeating process,” (Shull 13) individuals find an escape from the “capricious, discontinuous, and insecure” (13) nature of the ‘human world.’

The substituted new form of experience is built around the human-machine interface that she argues alleviate many of the modern anxieties around uncertainty that have emerged in our post-fordist capitalist society. 

She additionally argues that are now “[using] technologies to manufacture ‘certainties’” and “enact a mode of self-equilibrium,” through engaging with their predictable patterns and systematic modes of interfacing. Her research is indicative of larger social trends for our changing relationships with machines, as our increased intimacy with technology serves as a means of affective management and creates “a personal buffer zone against the uncertainties and worries of [the] world” (13).

The ethnographic material presented by Schull calls for a reconsideration of how we conceptualise the limits of bounded human self, shifting from a matter of physical flesh to a functional understanding that legitimises the harmoniously integrated experience of machine and player.
